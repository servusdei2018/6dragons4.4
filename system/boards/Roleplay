Long ago, in the Terizak Forest, a small golden orb began to tremble and quake with
the thrums of ancient power. Twas a portal. A doorway. An entrance for my physical
form to enter the realms of man. Yes. It was my egg. As the first golden ray of sun
penetrated the cracks of my shell, I felt the chaotic swirling of unseen forces. My heart
was called to the heavens, while my body was firmly tethered to the natural wonders of the earth.
My fore-sires knew from that moment, that I was bound to search. They saw the spark of divinity
within me that drew me out into the world. It begs me to find it. To discover. To learn.
They call me The Nomad of the Sky becuase my nature does not allow me to stay in any one
place for a significant passing of time. They call me SunScales because as I pass overhead
the hidden hues within my scales reflect the golden light of Brother-Star, and cause rainbows
to dance on the beings below. They call me foolish because I seek a power long forgotten.
My true name is unknown even to me, for only when I ascend to a state of enlightenment, 
only when I reach the precipice of perception will that ancient wisdom be imparted unto me.
And so, to this day, I quest. If you catch of glimpse of my tell-tale golden scales, shout to
me. For I will gladly land and have a brief discussion with you of the arcane, the mystical
or the purpose of life... but alas. I cannot stay long. I must travel the skies.

&RA Grassland
&gA grassland covers the entire sorrounding landscape here.
The wild grass growing as thin green stalks which ripple
endlessly in the furious wind.

&cLord Byron walks in from the east.

&CLord Byron says, 'Son!? Finally... I've been looking for ages to bring
you back ho-'

&CYou say 'Stop, Da. It's no use. I'm not going back with you. Not now. Not
ever. It's over. That's not my home anymore.'

&cLord Byron blinks in utter disbelief.

Lord Byron clears his throat, and looks solemnly at you.

&CLord Byron says, 'Thorne, you don't understand. Your petty crimes don't
mean anything to your family. You're just a pick-pocket. You've these
grand imaginings of living the life of a rogue, but that path is beset
on all sides by evil... evil and death. Trust me, Son. Come home.
We can't just dismiss your charges because of my position, but we can
seek the minimum ruling, and after a couple months in the cell you 
can have a fresh start. Please. Just come back to Blackburn castle, 
and we'll see if the healers can't figure out a way to treat your-'

&CYou scream, 'I don't need a HEALER, Da. I'm not ILL. My way is not
a sign of an addled mind. My life is not the result of some unseen
disease. My life is the result of your foolishness. But I can't give 
you all the credit, Da. It's you and those bumbling idiots you call
offspring. I will NOT apologize for something I couldn't control.
I refuse to feel remorse so that you can try to escape blame. You
chose to make me invisible. You chose to make me seek my thrills outside
the castle. And I love this life, Da. It suits me. My talents are in
the Rogue's trade, and that's what I'll live 'til the day I no longer
draw breath.'

&cYou turn your back on Lord Byron and begin to walk slowly away...

&CLord Byron says, 'Fitting name your mother chose. Thorne...'

&cLord Byron lets out a dry, half-chuckle.

&CLord Byron says 'If I had known before that you would be EXACTLY
that... a thorn in the side of the Blackburn legacy... Ah. Maybe I 
would've stopped having heirs after the third.'

&cIn one lightning-quick movement you spin on your heel, knock and arrow
back onto the string of your bow, and loose a shot directly for Lord Byron's
neck.

&zYour arrow &w***SMITES***&z Lord Byron!
&RLord Byron is DEAD!!!
&wLord Byron hits the ground ... DEAD.
You get all the jewelery, coins, and items from the corpse of Lord Byron.
&BThe corpse of Lord Byron holds:
Nothing.

&cYou straigten your posture, draw your hood and begin to walk slowly
toward the west...

&CYou say, 'Tell Ma, I said Hello, father. And that I miss her more than
I'll ever miss you...'

&RThe Tribe does not forgive...

&zWe Kanteros, or as most races call us, "Centaurs" are proud and reclusive 
at the best of times. Most choose to live their lives in tribes or clans outside
the influence of integrated society. Once upon a moon, I belonged to such a clan.
I spent my youth hunting near Red-Wolf River, and learning how to interpret the
patterns of the heavenly bodies. Kanteros tribes have great respect for divination 
by these means. When I was still a colt, my mother told me of the stars the day of
my birth. She said I was born under a &RBlood Moon&z in the era of Gant. The 
constellation of the scholar. She always said this marked great things for my
future, but I doubted that one such as I, with no social ranking among the tribe
would ever amount to much of anything. It is only recently, that I have come to appreciate
how much insight she had.


No longer a foal, the time for apprenticeships, and trades had come. The Tribe Chieftain
has the authority to appoint such placements, stemming from talents, dispositions, and
breeding. It shocked the entire tribe when he pronounced, upon my 16th year, that I was to
be selected as a warrior. The protectors of the clan. The bravest, fiercest, and most often,
heartless of us all. They patrol the parameters of tribe territory, and keep any threats
away from the safety and comfort of our home-land. This was not me. This title, this task.
It was laid upon me without thought, without hesitation, and without merit. I couldn't
understand what would provoke Chieftain Relquine to proclaim such a thing. But my mother
was quick to explain what had transpired without my knowledge.

&G(Part II)

&C"I spoke with Relquine. I offered him several of your father's remaining
weapons, and half a years service on his staff to get him to appoint you as
a warrior. I know you're shocked, Nick, but the stars have shown your greatness.
This is the only way you will ever achieve what Gaia has set forth for you, Son!"

&zMy mother's eyes swam with happy tears. She had acted out of love, but my heart
sank to my hooves. A warrior is meant to be a beast, and I am no beast.

&C"Ma', I love you and you know that, but this life is not mine. I cannot raid
bandit camps, and protect our borders from packs of vampires, or demons. I cannot
act without thought, or take orders without weighing the consequences. All these
things will be required of me, if I enlist in the patrol. Your kindness and devotion
is well received, but the outcome couldn't be more opposite my nature."

&zI believe she understood, but it did not matter. We both knew the path was set.
Chieftain Relquine's word is law amongst the tribe. There was no turning back. I would
be trained, and would serve in the Warrior Patrol. And because of the effort she took
to ensure this, I swore I would do my very best to uphold the ideals she had.

After two long seasons of training, the time had come to set out on my first patrol...

*ZThe sun was bright upon our path that day. I heard the call of creatures within
the forest, and the slow trickle of water through the streams feeding into the 
Red-Wolf River. I was fortunate enough, that my patrol captain was quite fair,
and didn't seem to have any judgement for me regarding my placement in the patrol.
We stayed in formation, armed with bows and spears in case of threat. We made our way
through bends, and curves in the path. Little conversation took place, and I was able
to relish in the thrum of nature, and the feeling of home.

&C*A scream of terror pierced the forest....*

&zInstinct overcame me. I felt myself moving. I barely felt the tread of my gallop. I was 
flying through the trees. I knew where the scream had come from. Seconds later, I was standing
before a patch of quick-sand. The scream had come from a creature that was struggling to 
free itself from the deadly mire. It had no real face. Only eyes, and long appendages
that writhed, and searched for something to provide purchase, to pull free of the muck.

Sheer terror pulsed off the beast. It's language was confusing. Clicks, hums, pops...
But I felt it's emotions washing over me as if they were my own. I knew that I had to help
this being out. It couldn't be more than a child. I reached my spear out toward the young
creature, but this only provoked another staggering wave of terror to wash over
us both. I pulled my spear back to my side, as my Patrol captain came rushing up beside me.

&C"Nicodemus! Leave it be! That dark creature is a mind-flayer. If its life wasn't in danger,
it would've already broken your mind, and taken your energy for its own. Archers! Ready!"

&RNO! LEAVE IT BE!"
&zThe words left my mouth, but my patrol didn't heed them. I felt, more than heard, a rain of
arrows being released from the tension of their short-bows. Time seemed to slow to a crawl.
No longer acting as Nicodemus the timid, aspiring warrior, I operated on pure instinct.

&w My hand raised to my shoulder of its own volition. I felt a wall of energy being erected between
my patrol and the tentacle-child. More than a dozen arrows failed to meet their mark. More
than a few, snapped upon impact. The motion flowed into another, my hand reached out for
the child. Words formed on my lips, without calling them to mind.

&RCORPOREUS VOCARE PROCUL!

&zI blinked...

The beast-child stood on the opposite side of the sand-pit. Unharmed, but still fightened.
I felt winded, as the wild-magic receded back into its hiding place behind my heart.
My patrol raised their spears and bows as if to fire again, but before they could act...
Two larger tentacle beasts shimmered into existence behind the child. The larger of the two
newcomers, sliced his hand low through the air. A glowing &Bblue&z rift opened inside of
the stillness of the forest, and the three of them stepped through just as it collapsed.

I prepared myself for the storm to come... as I rejoined my enraged patrol-mates...

&RNicodemus Ashkevron, you stand before this Tribunal under the accusations of 
insubordination, endangering the lives of your patrol-mates, and using a
banned skill within the parameters of our land. Do you understand why these
charges have been set upon you, son?
&zThe voice of Chieftain Relquine was more pleased and amused than angry...

&C"Yes, Lordship. I understand the charges, and the reason I stand accused."

&RYou are well aware, that many ages ago this Tribe banned the practice of magic,
as we find it often leads to necromancy, to demonology, to vampirism, to
the dark arts, and often causes one's soul to become deformed in such a way that
no hope is found for absolution. Knowing this law, you full well studied, and
used the forbidden art to save the life of a natural enemy to this clan. Nicodemus,
how do you plead to the charges brought against you?
&zI hadn't studied any magic at all. The words, the power.. they came without beckoning.
But I wasn't going to stand and argue with the Chieftain at what could very well be
my death sentancing...

&C"I fully accept all charges, and acted accordingly to what the witnesses have reported, 
Lordship. I take upon myself full responsibility of my actions, and whatever consequences
you see fit to bestow. I would like to state, for the record, that my mother, nor any of
her kin, were ever aware that I studied the forbidden art. The guilt is mine, and mine alone."

&RYour family is not on trial, boy. Only you. Your mother, and any of her kin are clear of any
of the consequences you are yet to receive. I honestly thought I was doing you a favor by
appointing you as a warrior. I can see now, that I may have acted without wisdom. For I would
never knowingly appoint a Kanteros who is so willing to delve into the mystic, knowing the risks.

&zSilence. His eyes searched mine. He was looking for something. An answer? A challenge? I don't know.

&RMy formal judgement as Chieftain of this tribe is thus: You are to be banished. Banished from this Tribe,
banished from this land. Banished from this sector of known Kanteros settlement. From now, until the day
Gaia reclaims you as her own, you are exiled. You may never again ally yourself with another clan,
and may only find solace and community in other Kanteros who share the status of "Exiled" with you.
Your mother and her family can remain here, but under no circumstances shall you ever have communication
with them again. By any and all standards, you are dead to this realm. Now take your leave, before I sway
my mind in the way of an execution.

&z I didn't respond. I walked away, took what little I could carry, and took up my travels. I swore that
I would hold true to my mother's interpretation of the stars. I would find greatness. And it appeared
as if I would do so... in the land of men.

&gI had traveled now for many days. I was still leagues away from the outskirts
of my old Tribe's parameter. I had not betrayed any of the Chieftain's decleration
of exile... yet. 

&zWhile journeying abroad and learning the ways of the arcane, I have heard many rumours.
Rumours circulating through occult circles, through shaman huts, and apothecary trade stops.
There exists, a level of magic, so raw and powerful... so mysterious and forgotten that many
do not know its name. The standards of mage-hood came easily to me, as the first spell I'd ever
cast to save the life of the mindflayer child. I knew the only way I would challenge myself,
and claim my destiny would be to search for this mysterious power and take it as my own.

&gI decided to make a small camp on the dark green hills on the territory north of my old home.
I dared not travel to this location by magic, for the threat of being detected by the tribe's shaman
and medicine woman. While they considered their art more primal and natural, I had come to learn that
the mana that flowed through them during their rites and sympathetic performances, was the same mana
I could harness to turn the world on its side. I knew if I caused a temporal disturbance with a portal,
or astral rift.. they would more than likely sense my presence.

&zWhy had I come? A death wish, perhaps? I was close to my Kanteros kinsfolk but still within my rights as
an exile. I had come for one reason, and one reason alone. I was going to break that exile by communicating with
my mother. How many years had passed? Losing count of the days is effortless. I knew she would be worried, and
would always wonder if I had achieved my true destiny. I was banned from communication or fellowship with her
specfically, and also any Kanteros who did not share in my exile. But I believe I had a plan that would bypass
any detection and allow me to get a message to her.

&cI was careful... critically careful. I drew from the well-spring of power behind my heart, an amazingly tiny
sliver of mana. I molded it, shaped it, made it invisible to all but one. I imprinted her energetic mark
upon it, and gave it a message. I wrapped it in the ambient energy that permated the air here. Even a mage
who was actively scanning the sector of Kanteros settlement, wouldn't notice anything out of the ordinary.
The only possible method of detection, would be if someone knew I was sending this message at this very time.
I chuckled internally, at how skilled I had become at manipulating mana over the years. I whispered a silent
prayer and released my tether to the message, and felt it flutter away toward it's target.

&P**Miles away within the heart of the Kanteros settlement - Sylvia Ashkevron tended to crops out in the field.
Her heart came alive, like it hadn't for so long now, because for a brief moment she heard a voice she had
thought she would never hear again. The words rang within her mind as clear as a bell...**

&C"Mother. It's me, Nick. I'm safe. I'm happy. And very soon, I will meet my destiny. I will be a sorcerer."
