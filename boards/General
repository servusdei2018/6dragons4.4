Riddle Quest: Answer it correct in a note to Ludum, and win GLORY!

In ancient times there was a thief who was very clever and caught stealing by
a town guard. The judge who oversaw his public trial was very compassionate.
Although he sentanced the thief to death, he told the thief "My clever rogue,
being a man of heart, I shall allow you to choose your own method. Tell me
the way in which you would like to die." 

The thief was exceedingly intelligent. He pondered for a moment and then met the
judge's remarks with a clever answer. Once the answer was given, the judge
released the thief and dropped the charges.

For 100 glory, what did the thief say to the judge?

I will reveal the answer and winners next week.

I dowloaded a copy of this codebase and I've run into two bugs that I 
cannot seem to figure out. I'm not sure how active you might be, so I am 
hoping you might be able to help me out. The first is when you log into 
the game, it doesn't take any input, while the game does display the 
greeting, which typically asks if you are new or existing, typing anything 
just results in being kicked back into the handler. I think the bug is 
somewhere in genesis.c in how it handles moving from the sending of the 
greeting to accepting the name. I notice you have the same bug on your 
live game here. Typing new or your character name at the beginning results 
in Illegal name or unknown, and then you end up at the Name: prompt. If 
you can let me know where to fix that, or where I can track that down, it 
would be great, I just haven't been able to figure it out. The next one is 
in void do_who, a player flagged as AFK or RP shows with a single [ by 
their name, rather than the whole [RP] or [AFK] beside it. Was curious if 
you might have a fix for that one as well. I haven't dug into that one 
quite as much as I did the login issue above. Appreciate all the work you 
did on the 6D codebase, I ran a mud for about 15 years and the base we 
were on was abandoned, and we were looking to move to something a bit more 
current (sorta) and convert our areas and code that we liked over to it, 
long as the code bones were right. 6Dragons looked like a good choice.

The bug that I mentioned is in comm.c in void read_from_buff. It is 
putting a V infront of the new players name at the beginning, that's why 
it won't properly work. I haven't tracked down exactly what the issue is, 
but perhaps you can. Just thought I'd let you know.
